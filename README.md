Welcome to MadLibs by ThinkingEmoji. 

This is a portfolio project during my JavaScript learning process. I am currently working on the full-stack engineer program through Codecademy: https://www.codecademy.com

Note: This game is written for use in node.js. It may not function without dependencies installed.

Dependencies:

Node.js installed: https://nodejs.org/en/

prompt-sync installed: https://github.com/heapwolf/prompt-sync

You may contact me if you have questions or comments about my program, coding in general, or if you want to hire me for something! Please do not contact me with sales solicitations.
